ABSTRACT: Low levels of health insurance coverage have occupied a central role in policymakers’ efforts to explain the United States’ comparatively poor health outcomes. However, existing microeconometric literature has yielded mixed findings regarding the causal link between health insurance access and physical health. This study leverages state-level variation in Medicaid eligibility emerging from incomplete compliance with the statutes of the Affordable Care Act to estimate the causal effect of health insurance eligibility on mortality rates and insurance coverage in the United States. Analysing county-level mortality data from the Center for Disease Control with a staggered adoption difference-in-differences specification, this study finds little evidence that the ACA Medicaid expansions caused a decrease in all cause mortality, despite strong and significant increases in insurance coverage and decreases in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system. This is the first empirical research to incorporate staggered adoption of Medicaid expansion into a two-way fixed effects framework, leveraging novel estimators developed in the theoretical econometrics literature to consistently estimate treatment effects and their dynamics.
